# 📘 Prefix Sums, Difference Arrays & Coordinate Compression – Quick Notes

---

## 📌 1. Prefix Sums (1D & 2D)

### ✅ 1D Prefix Sum

Used to find sum of elements in a subarray in **O(1)** after **O(N)** preprocessing.

**Formula:**
Prefix\[i] = A\[0] + A\[1] + ... + A\[i]

**Query (L to R):**
`Sum = Prefix[R] - Prefix[L - 1]` (assume Prefix\[-1] = 0)

**Example:**
A = \[1, 2, 9, -1, -2, 3]
Prefix = \[1, 3, 12, 11, 9, 12]

---

### ✅ 2D Prefix Sum

Used for **fast rectangular sum queries** in grids.

**P\[i]\[j]** = Sum of grid\[0..i]\[0..j]
**Query (r1,c1 to r2,c2):**

```
Sum = P[r2][c2] 
    - P[r1-1][c2] 
    - P[r2][c1-1] 
    + P[r1-1][c1-1]
```

🧠 *Can also apply XOR or other associative ops similarly.*

## 📌 2. Difference Arrays

Useful for **range updates** in O(1) per update, O(N) to finalize.

### ✅ Idea:

For update (L, R, X):

* Add X at D\[L]
* Subtract X at D\[R+1]

**Final Array:**
Prefix sum of D

**Example:**
Start: \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Update: (1, 3, 5) → D = \[0, 5, 0, 0, -5]
Final: \[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

### ✅ Time Complexity:

* Updates: O(1) each
* Final output: O(N)
* Total: O(N + Q)

## 📌 3. Coordinate Compression

Coordinate Compression is a technique used to **map large or scattered values to a smaller, contiguous range of indices**. This is especially useful when the values in an array are very large (e.g., up to 1e12) or sparse, but you need to use them as indices in data structures like Fenwick Trees, Segment Trees, or arrays.

---

### ✅ When to Use

- When the array values are large, but the number of unique values is small.
- When you need to efficiently use values as indices in arrays or trees.
- When you want to reduce memory usage or speed up lookups.

---

### ✅ How It Works

1. **Collect all values you want to compress.**
   - This could be all elements of an array, or all endpoints in a set of queries.
2. **Extract unique values.**
   - Use a set or sort + unique to get rid of duplicates.
3. **Sort the unique values.**
   - This gives you the order for mapping.
4. **Map each value to its index in the sorted list.**
   - The smallest value gets 0, the next smallest gets 1, and so on.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Example

Suppose you have an array:
```
A = [10000000000, 1, 50, 1, 50]
```

**Step 1:** Collect all values  
`[10000000000, 1, 50, 1, 50]`

**Step 2:** Extract unique values  
`[1, 50, 10000000000]`

**Step 3:** Sort  
`[1, 50, 10000000000]`

**Step 4:** Map each value to its index  
- 1 → 0  
- 50 → 1  
- 10000000000 → 2

**Result:**  
`{1: 0, 50: 1, 10000000000: 2}`

Now, you can replace each value in the original array with its compressed index:
```
Compressed A = [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]
```

---

### ✅ Code Snippet (C++)

```cpp
vector<long long> a = {10000000000, 1, 50, 1, 50};
vector<long long> vals = a; // Copy all values

// 1. Sort and remove duplicates
sort(vals.begin(), vals.end());
vals.erase(unique(vals.begin(), vals.end()), vals.end());

// 2. Map each value to its compressed index
unordered_map<long long, int> compress;
for (int i = 0; i < vals.size(); ++i) {
    compress[vals[i]] = i;
}

// 3. Replace values in original array
for (auto &x : a) {
    x = compress[x];
}
```

---

### ✅ Applications

- **Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree:** Use compressed indices for range queries/updates.
- **Segment Tree:** Efficiently store and query intervals.
- **Difference Array:** When updates/queries are on large values.
- **Sweep Line Algorithms:** Compress event coordinates for efficient processing.

---

### ✅ Tips

- Always include all values you might need to compress (including query endpoints).
- If you need to decompress (get the original value from the compressed index), keep the sorted unique array.
- Coordinate compression does **not** preserve the original values, only their relative order.

---

**Summary:**  
Coordinate Compression lets you work with large or sparse values as if they were small, dense indices—making many algorithms and data structures practical and efficient!
