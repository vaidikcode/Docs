## - Alkalinity and Chloride Content

* **H₂SO₄ (Methyl Orange)** → 25 mL water
* **AgNO₃ (Potassium Dichromate)** → 10 mL water
* *(5 Times each)*

## - Temporary and Permanent Hardness of Water

* We need hard water which will be provided.

* **EDTA** → 10 mL Hard Water
  (**Ammonium Chloride Buffer (2–3 mL) + EBT indicator**)
  *(4 times)*

* Water gives **total hardness**

* Distilled water gives **permanent hardness**

## - Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺

* **KMnO₄** → 10 mL FAS + 5 mL H₂SO₄ *(5 times)*
* **KMnO₄** → 10 mL Given Sol + 5 mL H₂SO₄ *(5 times)* (**Fe²⁺**)
* **KMnO₄** → 10 mL Given Sol + 5 mL H₂SO₄ *(5 times)* (**Total Iron Content**)

## - NaOH and Na₂CO₃

* **HCl** → 10 mL Na₂CO₃ (Methyl Orange) *(5 Times)*

* **HCl** → 10 mL of mixture of both NaOH and Na₂CO₃
  (2–3 drops of **Phenolphthalein**) → **\[P]**

* The first corresponds to **P endpoint**,
  in same solution add 2–3 drops of **Methyl Orange**

## - To Determine the Copper Content of a Given Sample of Copper Ore Solution

* Using **0.1 N Sodium Thiosulphate**

### PROCEDURE

1. Pipette out **10 mL** of the copper ore solution into a titration flask.
2. Add a small amount of **solid NaHCO₃** to the ore solution in small doses until there is **no effervescence**. The solution turns **milky**.
3. Add **dilute acetic acid dropwise**, just enough to remove the milkiness. A **clear blue solution** is formed.
4. Add **5 mL of 10% KI solution**. The solution turns **dark brown** due to formation of **KI₃**.
5. Add about **35 mL of distilled water** to dilute the contents. Wait for **at least 3 minutes**.
6. Titrate the solution against **standard sodium thiosulphate solution** until the color turns **pale/light yellow**.
7. Add about **2 mL of 1% freshly prepared starch solution**. The color turns **deep blue**.
8. Continue titration with more sodium thiosulphate until the color changes from **blue to permanent white**.
9. Let the flask sit for some time. If the solution turns **blue again**, add a few more drops of **Na₂S₂O₃** until the solution remains permanently white.
10. Repeat the experiment **at least 5 times**, ensuring at least **2 concordant readings** are obtained.

* Determine pKa value of acetic acid by pH metric titration
  Titration of unknown HA with standard NaOH

1. Calibrate the pH meter with the standard buffer solution of pH = 4 or 9, then rinse the glass
   electrode and immerse it in the beaker. Position the burette so that the titrant can be easily added.
2. Pipette out 50 ml of acetic acid into a clean beaker, dip the glass electrode. Record the pH.
3. Initially, add 0.5 ml of 0.1 N NaOH solution at a time, record the pH (after each addition), until
   the pH change is more than 0.2‒0.3 units, then start adding 0.2 ml of NaOH each time (i.e., near
   to the equivalence point, decrease the volume of NaOH added) so that the change in pH is small
   enough to yield a good shape of plot.
4. After the rapid change in pH (after the equivalent point), the volume of NaOH may again be
   increased to 0.5 ml per addition. Make at least 10 more additions after the equivalence point so
   that the region with the plateau can be plotted.

* standard electrode potential of ferrous-ferric
  system.

PROCEDURE

1. Take 50 ml of 0.1 N FAS solution in the beaker and add 5 ml of 1N sulphuric acid. Dip the
   platinum and saturated calomel electrodes in the solution.
2. Connect the indicator and the reference electrodes to the black and red terminals of the
   potentiometer, respectively.
3. Rinse and fill the burette with KMnO4 (0.2 N).
4. Note the initial emf of the cell and start addition of the titrant (KMnO4) in portions of 1 mL
   each. Near the equivalence point, decrease the volume of additional titrant to 0.5 ml and later on
   to 0.2 ml and note down to reading after each addition.
5. Continue to take 10-12 readings more, after a sharp change/increase in emf is noticed.
6. Plot emf (in volts) against the volume of KMnO4 solution added (mL) and note down the
   equivalence point and the potential at half the equivalence point.

* EXPERIMENT: Spectrophotometric determination of iron(II) with 1,10-phenanthroline

PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples

1. Take six 50 mL volumetric flasks and add 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ml of FAS solution in each flask. Let’s
   name these volumetric flasks as K, L, M, N, O and P.
2. Then add 2 ml of 1,10-phenanthroline solution to each of these volumetric flasks.
3. Now dilute each volumetric flask with deionised water to afford a total volume of 50 mL (by
   filling the these flasks upto the mark). Stopper the flasks and mix the contents well by shaking
   vigorously for few minutes. Allow the solution to stand for 10 minutes.
4. The first volumetric flask to which 0 ml of FAS is added (i.e., no Fe2+ ions), will serve as a
   blank. (Solution K).
   The Fe concentration in these flasks will be:
   K 0.0 N N 6.0 × 10⁻⁵ N
   L 2.0 × 10⁻⁵ N O 8.0 × 10⁻⁵ N
   M 4.0 × 10⁻⁵ N P 10.0 × 10⁻⁵ N

B. To determine the λmax

1. Get the two cuvettes issued from the laboratory staff.
2. Fill one of them with the blank solution (K) and another one with the one of the samples
   containing Fe. Let’s say solution P.
3. Light of single wavelength can be produced by selecting the filter on the photocolorimeter.
   Usually, the range goes from 410 nm‒700 nm.
4. Set the filter to 410 nm. Place the cuvette filled with blank solution, K, in the sample holder.
5. Set the absorbance to 0%.
6. Now place the second cuvette, with solution P, in the sample holder. Measure the absorbance
   of the solution. Now you have the absorbance at 410 nm for solution P.
7. By changing the filter to next wavelength each time, repeat steps 4‒6. You need to set the
   absorbance to zero with blank (K) every time you change the wavelength with filter.
8. Now, you have absorbance of solution P, over a range of wavelength from 410 nm-700 nm. You
   will notice that graph between the Absorbance and wavelength takes an inverse parabola
   shape, with a maximum absorbance around 500 nm or 480 nm. This is your λmax.

C. Measurement of Absorbance for Solutions L to P at λmax

1. Set the filter to λmax obtained in part B (step 8).
2. Set the absorbance to 0 using your blank sample (K).
3. Measure the absorbance for solutions L to P now at λmax. Don’t disturb the filter in between.
4. Now measure the absorbance for an unknown sample provided to you.
5. Plot absorbance vs. concentration for samples L to P. Connecting maximum points, draw a
   straight line ideally passing through origin.
6. Using absorbance value for the unknown, find out its concentration.
